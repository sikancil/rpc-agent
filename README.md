# RPC Agent: Your Minimalist RPC Framework üöÄ

This project provides a lightweight and efficient RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework built with TypeScript.  It's designed for simplicity and ease of use, with no external dependencies.

## What is RPC Agent?

RPC Agent allows you to define and execute remote procedures, enabling communication between different parts of your application or even across networks.  Think of it as a simple, yet powerful, way to make different parts of your system talk to each other.

## Core Features ‚ú®

* **TypeScript Support:**  Leverages TypeScript for type safety and improved code maintainability.
* **Extensible:** Easily add new RPC methods and extensions.
* **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly across various environments (Node.js, shell scripts, etc.).
* **Well-Structured:**  Clean and organized codebase for easy understanding and modification.

## Advantages üí™

* **Lightweight:**  Minimal footprint, ideal for resource-constrained environments.
* **Fast:**  Optimized for speed and performance.
* **Easy to Use:**  Simple API for quick integration into your projects.
* **Flexible:**  Adaptable to various use cases and integration scenarios.

## Project Types, Use Cases, and Integrations üéØ

RPC Agent is suitable for a wide range of projects and use cases:

* **Microservices:**  Enable communication between microservices within a distributed system.
* **Client-Server Applications:**  Facilitate communication between clients and servers.
* **Internal Communication:**  Simplify communication between different modules or components within a single application.
* **Automation Scripts:**  Integrate with shell scripts for automated tasks.
* **Node.js Applications:**  Seamless integration with Node.js projects.
